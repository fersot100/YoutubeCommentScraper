Sun Apr 16 2017 15:41:50 GMT-0700 (PDT) : It's always the same old, us vs them bullshit. Realize this, you've aquired most of your opinions from other people, and most of your beliefs are based on preconcieved notions. Nothing is ever as you imagine it would be, so stop relying on your "imagined" truths, and wake yourself up from the fact that you don't know shit, and if you think you do, think again. Stop, and question the validity of your beliefs, why you have them, and are they really correct, or subjective hogwash that fits best with how you feel. Most people think in terms of their emotional reasoning, and not their logical reasoning. They feel that Trump is a bad person, so therefore, they've allowed their emotions to warp their perspective, and now they think that he is a bad person.
